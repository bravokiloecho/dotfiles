# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. So far they include a config for ZSH and that is all.

## Setup

First clone the repo into your home directory:

```
cd ~ && git clone git@github.com:bravokiloecho/dotfiles.git
```

Then create a symlink to the ZSH config that lives in this repo:

```
ln -s ~/dotfiles/.zshrc ~/.zshrc
```
